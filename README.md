Through the summer project, we aim to study stochastic processes. We first study examples
of the Levy process, the Brownian motion and Poisson Process, and then generalize the results
and study Levy process. We conclude the project by studying the Ito Integral and briefly familiarizing
ourselves with Stochastic Differential equations.
We study Brownian Motion mainly from Morters and Peres (2003), along with Klenke (2008).
We study the construction, continuity and differential property of the Brownian motion along
with the Cameron Martin theorem, the martingale and Markov property, along with Filtration
of the Brownian motion.
We then study Poisson Process from Billingsley (1986), Taylor and Karlin (1984) and Klenke
(2008). We study Random measures, the equivalent conditions for Poisson Processes, the law
of rare events, the Poisson point process and conclude with Multi-Dimensional Poisson processes.
We study Levy processes from Applebaum (2004). We study The Jumps in a Levy process,
Poisson Integration and examples of Levy Processes and introduces ourselves to Ito integrals
via Levy Ito decomposition.
We study Ito Integrals, its properties, its extensions. We study the Ito Formula and get introduced
to stochastic differential equations from Ã˜ksendal (2000).
